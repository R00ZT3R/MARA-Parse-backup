I haven't organized hackathons before, but I have organized school events such as concerts and dances and other similar events. I am just entering the realm of hackathons, and after participating in and winning my first hackathon, I want to participate in and organize more hackathons. I think hackathons are great events for learning, making connections, and just hustling. The time limit really makes you grind, and that feeling is actually kind of satisfying. I think another great part is seeing your finished or almost finished product at the end, and it also feels quite nice to finish parts of it during the hackathon as well. I think at HTNE, you organize a fun event where people can get better at programming, make connections, and just have a good time. I usually play the role of the leader. I plan out what work we should get done first, and how we should do it. I make sure everyone's doing their part of the work, and I do as much work as I can myself.
